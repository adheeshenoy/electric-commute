# Electric Commute
This web-app is designed to help you plan your electric transport journeys efficiently. With Electirc Communte, you can calculate the estimated time it will take to travel a specific distance on an electric transport. You can also input the amount of time you have and the app would calculate the maximum distance that the electric transport can travel in that given time.
